# Instructions

## ILOG CPLEX

For this build to work a version of the IBM ILOG CPLEX and an installer
file must be present in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

An academic license can be obtained for [IBM ILOG CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) by students and
researchers with a University associated email. Once you register and are
approved, you can download the IBM ILOG CPLEX binary from the IBM website.

## Dockerfile

Since IBM ILOG CPLEX will need to be installed non-interactively, you will
first need to generate an `installer.properties` file. This can be accomplished
by running:

```
./<path/to/CPLEX_binary> -r
```
