# Instructions

## ILOG CPLEX

For this build to work a version of the IBM ILOG CPLEX and an
`installer.properties` file must be present in the same directory as the
Dockerfile.

An academic license can be obtained for
IBM ILOG CPLEX by students and researchers with a University associated email.
Once you register and are approved, you can download the IBM ILOG CPLEX binary
from the [IBM website](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio).

## Dockerfile

Since IBM ILOG CPLEX will need to be installed non-interactively, you will
first need to generate an `installer.properties` file. This can be accomplished
by running:

```
./<path/to/CPLEX_binary> -r <path/to/directory_with_dockerfile>
```

**NOTE:** Running the CPLEX binary requires Java. On Ubuntu this can be
installed with `sudo apt-get install default-jre` if it is not already
available.

This will take your user input for the installation and output them into
a file, which can be read inside the Docker image to allow non-interactive
selection of install options.

This step is already run inside the Dockerfile, but FYI:
To install CPLEX non-interactively run:
```
./<path/to/CPLEX_binary> -f <path/to/installer.properties> -i silent
```

For more information about CPLEX binary options see:
```
./<path/to/CPLEX_binary> -h
```
